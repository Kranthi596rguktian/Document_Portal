I remember from school that the capital is Paris. But wait, maybe I should double-check. Sometimes countries have cities with similar names, but France is pretty straightforward.\n",

Like, some people might confuse it with Lyon or Marseille, but those are other cities in France. No, the capital is definitely Paris. \n",

      "Wait, has there ever been a time when the capital wasn't Paris? I don't think so. Even during different historical periods, Paris has remained the capital. Unless there was some temporary move, but that's not common knowledge. So, the answer should be Paris. \n",

      "I should also consider if the user is expecting any other information, like the population or landmarks, but the question is straightforward. Just the capital. So, the answer is Paris. No need to complicate it. Let me confirm once more. Quick search in my mind: France's capital is Paris. Yep, that's correct. Alright, I can confidently say Paris is the answer.\n",
